## Bulk Download

Now it is possible to download all images and videos of one profile at once. The Button apperes right next to the `follow` button.  The feature includes scrolling down until all images are loaded, so it may take a while. It is also possible that instagram will ban you temporarily (just a few minutes) if you try to download like 1000 pictures.  
If you click on the `download all` button the page will beginn scolling down to load the new pictures until every picture of the profile got loaded once. After that a ZIP file with all the images in it will be created.  
This may take a while depending on your internec connection and the amount of pictures you plan to download.
