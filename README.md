## Bulk Download

Now it is possible to download all images and videos of one profile at once. The Button apperes right next to the `follow` button.  The feature includes scrolling down until all images are loaded, so it may take a while. It is also possible that instagram will ban you temporarily (just a few minutes) if you try to download like 1000 pictures.
