The same happens if you hover over the profile picture.

Now it is possible to download all images and videos of one profile at once. The Button apperes right next to the `follow` button.  The feature includes scrolling down until all images are loaded, so it may take a while. It is also possible that instagram will ban you temporarily (just a few minutes) if you try to download like 1000 pictures. The zip download was made possible by [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip).
